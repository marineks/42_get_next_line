The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques 

that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that 

even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. 

At that, they probably didn't have too much time 

after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. 

And if that were true, there could be only one place 

where their civilization was hidden.
